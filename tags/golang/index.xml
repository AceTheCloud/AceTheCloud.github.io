Go’s OOP implementation is a bit different from traditional OOP languages like Java, Python, and Ruby, as it does not have classes. Instead, it uses a type-based inheritance mechanism, called “struct embedding”, to achieve inheritance-like behavior.
In Go, a struct is a composite data type that can have fields, methods, and other properties. The fields of a struct represent the state of an object, while the methods of a struct represent the behavior of an object.</description></item></channel></rss>

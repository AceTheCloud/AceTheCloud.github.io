It enables users to quickly and easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on Azure.
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that allows developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It uses a declarative configuration to define the desired state of an application and continuously works to maintain that state.
With AKS, users can leverage the power of Kubernetes without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.</description></item></channel></rss>

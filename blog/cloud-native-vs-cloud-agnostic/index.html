If the fact doesn&rsquo;t convince you, the statistics might. An element as simple as a website&rsquo;s load time carries weight. Statistics indicate that the first five seconds of a page load time have the greatest impact on conversion rates. So when consumer behavior has the greatest impact, it is profitable in the long run to modernize a business model accordingly.</p><p>The faster a company can develop and ship a product to its customers, the more likely it is to avoid problems in a fast-paced environment. Cloud Native as a form of technology is designed for this. It is a behavior-driven development model designed, built, and optimized to run in the cloud.</p><p>Cloud native applications can easily be mistaken as another tool for the digital first era or another platform. However, it is a complete shift to a set of different practices, automated testing, design, customer centric model and an accelerated production environment. With shorter delivery cycles and higher quality, working in the cloud native database requires a transformation within the entire development team of an organization.</p><h3 id=why-cloud-native->Why Cloud Native ?</h3><p>There are many aspects to being cloud-native including</p><ul><li>Infrastructure Services</li><li>Automation/Orchestration</li><li>Virtualization and Containerization</li><li>Microservices Architecture</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s never been a better time to realize the full potential of the cloud by refactoring or rebuilding your applications cloud-native. In essence, this means that your application is built using modern cloud technologies and is hosted and managed end-to-end in the cloud. This includes writing code, testing and deploying the code, and running those applications—all in the cloud.</p><h3 id=benefits-for-your-business-to-go-cloud-native>Benefits for your business to go cloud-native</h3><ul><li>Reduced time to market.</li><li>Reduced cost</li><li>Improved customer experiences</li><li>Ease of management</li><li>Reliable systems and reduced down-time</li><li>Scalability</li><li>Increased Security</li></ul><p>I highly recommend this book to understand Cloud Native Design Patterns in depth
<img src=/images/blog/cloudnativebook.jpg alt="blog image"></p><h3 id=cloud-agnostic>Cloud Agnostic</h3><p>An organization is cloud-agnostic when the organization&rsquo;s IT systems are not tied to a single cloud provider or do not rely on a cloud provider&rsquo;s proprietary services.</p><p>Typically, services are distributed across multiple cloud providers to maintain and ensure the uptime of critical applications.</p><p>A cloud-agnostic approach has many advantages, e.g. organisation is not tied to a specific provider and has more choice and flexibility. In addition, organizations can rest assured that they will see optimal performance from their application, regardless of the cloud environment they use.</p><p><img src=/images/blog/nativevsagnostic.png alt="blog image"></p><p>A cloud-agnostic strategy takes the inherent flexibility of using public cloud facilities to another level. When workloads and applications are built to run on any public cloud, preferences can be set to switch them between different vendors based on their performance and cost-effectiveness in the context of dynamic factors such as geography and the strengths and offerings of different vendors. Or if temporary technical problems occur with a provider.</p><p>Cloud-agnostic offers a level of flexibility that improves <strong>cost-efficiency</strong> even more than simply using the public cloud. Especially for organizations with heavy workloads, even small cost differences can add up to significant sums. And for many digitally-enabled organizations, incremental performance gains and insurance against technical issues on the vendor side are as much an incentive to become cloud-agnostic as cost savings</p><h3 id=these-benefits-can-help-companies-better-understand-what-value-to-expect-when-developing-a-cloud-agnostic-approach>These benefits can help companies better understand what value to expect when developing a cloud-agnostic approach.</h3><p>◼ Portability ensures that an application works independently of the platform and can seamlessly migrate from one cloud platform to another.</p><p>◼ Consistent performance is a valuable characteristic of cloud agnostic, as companies benefit from a standard of performance (speed and scale) independent of the platform or infrastructure the application or service is running on.</p><p>◼ Cost optimization is a primary tenet of a cloud-agnostic architecture. As pricing models change between cloud providers, cloud-agnostic applications can be migrated easily to run in the cloud platform that delivers the best cost savings.</p><p>◼ Avoiding vendor lock-in ensures that companies are not subject to one operating platform, but have the freedom to move applications as they see fit.</p></article></div></div></div></section></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><div class=footer-subscribe-title><h2>Get the latest blog updates</h2></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto"><form action=# class=footer-subscribe-form><div class=from-group><div class=input-group><input type=email class=form-control placeholder="Enter Your E-mail"><div class=subscribe><button class="btn btn-subscribe" type=submit>

It is a fully managed service that allows users to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models, as well as explore and analyze large data sets.
So, when might Azure Databricks be a good choice for your organization? Here are a few key scenarios:
Large-scale data processing and analysis: If you have large data sets that need to be processed and analyzed quickly, Azure Databricks can be a great solution.</description></item><item><title>A Beginner's Guide to Multi-Cloud Networking: Key Concepts and Best Practices</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/multicloud-networking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 20:18:07 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/multicloud-networking/</guid><description>Multi-cloud networking refers to the ability to connect and use multiple cloud computing environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), in a coordinated manner. This allows organizations to take advantage of the different features and capabilities offered by each cloud provider, and to create a more resilient and flexible infrastructure.
There are several ways to enable multi-cloud networking, depending on your specific requirements and the tools and services you are using.</description></item><item><title>Amabassador Pattern</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 17:38:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</guid><description>Resilient cloud-based applications require features such as circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. It may be difficult or impossible to update legacy applications or existing code libraries to add these features, because the code is no longer maintained or can&amp;rsquo;t be easily modified by the development team.
Network calls also require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization. If these calls are used across multiple applications, built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances.</description></item><item><title>JWT Authentication using GoLang</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 17:38:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-golang/</guid><description>What is JWT JSON Web Token (JWT) is a widely used standard for securely transmitting information between parties. It is commonly used to transmit information that can be verified and trusted, because it is digitally signed.
JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.</description></item><item><title>GoLang Frameworks: An Overview of the Most Popular Options</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/famous-golang-frameworks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 20:18:07 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/famous-golang-frameworks/</guid><description>Go is a multiparadigm, statically-typed, and compiled programming language designed by Google. It is similar to C, and if you’re a fan of C, this can be an easy language to pick up. Many developers have embraced this language because of its garbage collection, memory safety, and structural typing system.
Why use Go? Before reviewing five top Go frameworks, what is Go truly used for? Aside from building general web applications, the language’s scope encompasses a wide range of use cases:</description></item><item><title>MLOPS 101: An Introduction to Managing Machine Learning in Production</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/introduction-to-mlops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 22:18:07 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/introduction-to-mlops/</guid><description>Background The practices and technology of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) offer a managed, scalable means to deploy and monitor machine learning models within production environments. MLOps best practices allow businesses to successfully run AI.
MLOps is modeled on DevOps, the existing practice of more efficiently writing, deploying, and managing enterprise applications. DevOps began as a way to unite software developers (the Devs) and IT operations teams (the Ops), destroying data silos and enabling better collaboration.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native vs Cloud Agnostic: Weighing the Trade-Offs</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/cloud-native-vs-cloud-agnostic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 20:18:07 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/cloud-native-vs-cloud-agnostic/</guid><description>Background Speed ​​is an important factor for business in this era when customers are looking for instant gratification. If the fact doesn&amp;rsquo;t convince you, the statistics might. An element as simple as a website&amp;rsquo;s load time carries weight. Statistics indicate that the first five seconds of a page load time have the greatest impact on conversion rates. So when consumer behavior has the greatest impact, it is profitable in the long run to modernize a business model accordingly.</description></item><item><title>Why Your Organization Needs a Service Mesh: The Benefits of Service Mesh Architecture and Istio</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/service-mesh-and-istio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 20:18:07 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/service-mesh-and-istio/</guid><description>Background A lot has changed about how we built microservices, and most people have no choice but to deploy microservices as pods in Kubernetes. Let us take an example where we are running a web application that queries data for the products. If both of these functionalities were on the webserver, then a calculation could slow the response time of the web pages. Having it on a seperate server avoids this problem.</description></item><item><title>Explainable AI</title><link>https://acethecloud.com/blog/explainable-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://acethecloud.com/blog/explainable-ai/</guid><description>Background Machine learning models are often viewed as “black boxes” where even their designers cannot explain how or why a model made a particular prediction. Explainable AI provides feature-based explanations and examples to better understand the model decision.
Knowing how a model behaves and how it is affected by its training set gives anyone creating or using ML new ways to improve models, build confidence in their predictions, and understand when and why things go wrong.</description></item></channel></rss>
